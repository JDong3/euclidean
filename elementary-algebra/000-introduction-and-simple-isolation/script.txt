NARRATING COURSE INTRODUCTION

narrator: Hi, welcome to my video series on Elementary Algebra. In this series
we will be exploring some major topic in elementary algebra, especially focusing
on the interpretation of them because I think its very important to give meaning
to the mathematics that you are studying, lest you miss the beauty and
significance of the objects of our

NARRATING TODAYS MATERIAL

narrator: Today we are going to take a look at the notion of a variable
quantinty (variable)

narrator: an equation

certain desired form.

NOTION OF A VARIABLE QUANTITY

narrator: Lets begin, first off I want to introduce the notion of a variable
quantity (also known as a variable)

fade in variable animation

narrator: A variable, or general quantity, is used as a placeholder for an
actual value

narrator: I am x meters and y centimeters tall

narrator: There are x birds on this tree

VARIABLES IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EQUATION

narrator: Variables themselves are not very interesting until they are used in
the context of an equation

fade in equation animation (x - 5 = 2)

narrator: what an equation does is that it puts restrictions on which values a
variable can take

narrator: since we know that x - 5 = 2 is true, then we also know that x = 8 is
true

narrator: It is important to remember that an equation is actually an assertion about
something. So when we write x - 5 = 2 can be interpreted as

"""
x minus 5 equals 2 is true, or x - 5 **is** equal to 2
"""

we can write the assertion about x like this

define: x - 5 = 2 is true

Now before we can start to work with equations we need a rule that tells us how
to manipulate these equations.

"""
Definition 1:
for all x in R, for all f in F, x = y is true => f[x] = f[y] is true
"""

for all real numbers x
for all functions f
if x is equal to y
then f applied to x is equal to f applied to y

we can quite easily see why this is the case with this example

"""
ex 1:
define 3 = 3 is true
infer: 3 + 2 = 3 + 2 is true
infer: 5 = 5 is true
"""

the idea of this rule is quite simple, if you know that two quantities are equal
(x = y) then if you change both quantities in the equation in the exact same
way, they will still be equal after the change (f[x] = f[y])

we can now use this rule to do a few problems

"""
ex 2:
isolate x
define: x - 5 = 1

define: f[x] = x + 5
f[x - 5] = f[1]
x - 5 + 5 = 1 + 5
x = 6
"""

"""
ex 3:
isolate x
define: 3x = 3

ndefine: f[x] = (1/3)x
f[3x] = f[3]
x = 1
"""

"""
ex 4:
isolate x
define: (2x+5)/4 = 3

2x + 5 = 12
2x = 7
x = 7/2
"""

"""
ex 5:
separate x and y onto different sides of the equality
define: (x - 2y)/2 = 1

x - 2y = 2
x = 2 + 2y
"""

""" ex 6: write terms containing x and y on one side of the equality and the
constant on the other side define: (2x + y + 3)/3 = 1

2x + y + 3 = 3
2x + y = 0
"""

x + 1 = 0
x - 1 = 2
2x = 1
x/5 = 2
(2x + 15)/3 = 2
