NARRATING COURSE INTRODUCTION

narrator: Hi, welcome to my video series on Elementary Algebra. In this series  we will be exploring some major topic in elementary algebra, especially focusing on the interpretation of them because I think its very important to give meaning to the mathematics that you are studying, lest you miss the beauty and significance of the objects of our interest.

NARRATING TODAYS MATERIAL

narrator: Today we are going to take a look at the notion of a variable quantity (variable)

NOTION OF A VARIABLE QUANTITY

narrator: Lets begin, first off I want to introduce the notion of a variable quantity (also known as a variable)

fade in variable animation

A variable is a general quantity, by itself it does not have too much meaning

here are some examples of general quantities or "variables"
"""
I am x m and y cm tall
There are x birds in the tree
"""

variables themselves are not very interesting until they are used in the context of an equation, an equation puts restrictions on the value of a variable

"""
x - 5 = 2
"""

since we know that x - 5 = 2 is true
we also know that x = 7 is true

It is important to remember that an equation is actually an assertion about something. So when we write x - 5 = 2 can be interpreted as

"""
x minus 5 equals 2 is true, or x - 5 **is** equal to 2
"""

we can write the assertion about x like this

define: x - 5 = 2 is true

Now before we can start to work with equations we need a rule that tells us how to manipulate these equations.

"""
Definition 1:
for all x in R, for all f in F, x = y is true => f[x] = f[y] is true
"""

for all real numbers x
for all functions f
if x is equal to y
then f applied to x is equal to f applied to y

we can quite easily see why this is the case with this example

"""
ex 1:
define 3 = 3 is true
infer: 3 + 2 = 3 + 2 is true
infer: 5 = 5 is true
"""

the idea of this rule is quite simple, if you know that two quantities are equal (x = y) then if you change both quantities in the equation in the exact same way, they will still be equal after the change (f[x] = f[y])

we can now use this rule to do a few problems

"""
ex 2:
isolate x
define: x - 5 = 1

define: f[x] = x + 5
f[x - 5] = f[1]
x - 5 + 5 = 1 + 5
x = 6
"""

"""
ex 3:
isolate x
define: 3x = 3

define: f[x] = (1/3)x
f[3x] = f[3]
x = 1
"""

"""
ex 4:
isolate x
define: (2x+5)/4 = 3

2x + 5 = 12
2x = 7
x = 7/2
"""

"""
ex 5:
separate x and y onto different sides of the equality
define: (x - 2y)/2 = 1

x - 2y = 2
x = 2 + 2y
"""

"""
ex 6:
write terms containing x and y on one side of the equality and the constant on the other side
define: (2x + y + 3)/3 = 1

2x + y + 3 = 3
2x + y = 0
"""


practice questions

x + 1 = 0
x - 1 = 2
2x = 1
x/5 = 2
(2x + 15)/3 = 2

NEXT TIME ... we will be taking a look at ...
