NARRATING COURSE INTRODUCTION

narrator: Hi, welcome to my video series on Elementary Algebra. In this series
we will be exploring some major topic in elementary algebra, especially focusing
on the interpretation of them because I think its very important to give meaning
to the mathematics that you are studying, lest you miss the beauty and
significance of the objects of our

================================================================================
NARRATING TODAYS MATERIAL

narrator: Today we are going to take a look at the notion of a variable
quantinty (variable)

narrator: an equation

narrator: and some methods that we can use to manipulate equations into a
certain desired form.

NOTION OF A VARIABLE QUANTITY

narrator: Lets begin, first off I want to introduce the notion of a variable
quantity (also known as a variable)

fade in variable animation

narrator: A variable, or general quantity, is used as a placeholder for an
actual value

narrator: I am x meters and y centimeters tall

narrator: There are x birds on this tree

VARIABLES IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EQUATION

narrator: Variables themselves are not very interesting until they are used in
the context of an equation

fade in equation animation (x - 5 = 2)

narrator: what an equation does is that it puts restrictions on which values a
variable can take

narrator: since we know that x - 5 = 2 is true, then we also know that x = 8 is
true. It is important to remember that an equation is actually an assertion
about something. So when we write x - 5 = 2 it is very useful to interpret it as
"x minus 5 equals 2 is true"

fade in animation for x minus 5 equals 2 is true

narrator: or x - 5 IS equals to 2, remember to keep these interpretations they
will be very helpful.

fade in animation for x minus 5 IS equal to 2

================================================================================
USEFUL PROPERTY OF EQUALITY

narrator: In order to work with equations we need a rule that tells us a way to
rewirte them and still have them make sense

fade in animation for property 1 of equality "Definition 1: for all x in R, for
all f in F, x = y is true => f[x] = f[y] is true "

narrator: for all real numbers x, for all functions f, if x is equal to y, then
f applied to x is equal to f applied to y. It is actually quite easy to see why
this property makes sense in this following example.

narrator: suppose that 3 = 3 is true

fade in animation for 3 = 3

narrator: now a function can be interpreted as a rule for how to change an
input, in this case our change will be +2. So by proprty of equality, we know
that 3 + 2 = 3 + 2.

fade in animation for 3 + 2 = 3 + 2

narrator: then 5 = 5, which is obviously true.

fade in animation for 5 = 5

narrator: the idea of this rule is quite simple, if you know that two quantities
are equal (x = y) then if you change both quantities in the exact same way, they
will still be equal after the change (f[x] = f[y])
