elementary algebra (Fundamentals for Higher Mathematics)

This video is part of a series about elementary algebra or just algebra, which is a natural extension to normal arithmetic. This topic usually deals with ideas regarding the notion of variables, functions of variables, and how to interpret them.

I'm also going to be talking about theorems in mathematics and their proofs, and put an emphasis on interpretation, since I think that those topics help give meaning to the math that were doing.

Now be before we begin, I would like to note that this series does not require knowledge of anything other and basic arithmetic, and fractions, but to make sure that we are on the same page please note that.

-1 * -1 = 1, -1 - (-1) = 0

DEFINITIONS AND IDEAS

Lets begin, first I want to introduce the idea of a variable
A variable is a general quantity, by itself it does not have too much meaning

here are some examples of general quantities or "variables"
"""
I am x m and y cm tall
There are x birds in the tree
"""

variables themselves are not very interesting until they are used in the context of an equation, an equation puts restrictions on the value of a variable

"""
x - 5 = 2
"""

since we know that x - 5 = 2 is true
we also know that x = 7 is true

It is important to remember that an equation is actually an assertion about something. So when we write x - 5 = 2 can be interpreted as

"""
x minus 5 equals 2 is true, or x - 5 **is** equal to 2
"""

we can write the assertion about x like this

define: x - 5 = 2 is true

Now before we can start to work with equations we need a rule that tells us how to manipulate these equations.

"""
Definition 1:
for all x in R, for all f in F, x = y is true => f[x] = f[y] is true
"""

for all real numbers x
for all functions f
if x is equal to y
then f applied to x is equal to f applied to y

we can quite easily see why this is the case with this example

"""
ex 1:
define 3 = 3 is true
infer: 3 + 2 = 3 + 2 is true
infer: 5 = 5 is true
"""

the idea of this rule is quite simple, if you know that two quantities are equal (x = y) then if you change both quantities in the equation in the exact same way, they will still be equal after the change (f[x] = f[y])

we can now use this rule to do a few problems

"""
ex 2:
isolate x
define: x - 5 = 1

define: f[x] = x + 5
f[x - 5] = f[1]
x - 5 + 5 = 1 + 5
x = 6
""

"""
ex 3:
isolate x
define: 3x = 3

define: f[x] = (1/3)x
f[3x] = f[3]
x = 1
"""

"""
ex 4:
isolate x
define: (2x+5)/4 = 3

2x + 5 = 12
2x = 7
x = 7/2
"""

"""
ex 5:
separate x and y onto different sides of the equality
define: (x - 2y)/2 = 1

x - 2y = 2
x = 2 + 2y
"""

"""
ex 6:
write terms containing x and y on one side of the equality and the constant on the other side
define: (2x + y + 3)/3 = 1

2x + y + 3 = 3
2x + y = 0
"""


practice questions

x + 1 = 0
x - 1 = 2
2x = 1
x/5 = 2
(2x + 15)/3 = 2
