last time we took a look at variables and we did some practice manipulating equations to isolate or move around the variables

this time we are going to take a look at the idea of a function and how to interpret it, how they relate to equations with 2 variables, and we will also start do some analysis on a type of function called a linear function

one way to express a function is as a rule that tell you how to map an input to an output

f[x] = 2x

a very useful way to analyze the behavior of a function is to try a list of inputs on the function and make a table of what you get out

table:
x, f[x]
1, 2
2, 4
3, 6
4, 8
5, 10

another powerful way to interpret a function is to find the graph of a function, we can use out table to plot values of x on the horizonal axis against values of f[x] on the vertical axis

we can actually connect the dots to form a line, since everywhere on the line the value on the f[x] axis is twice the value on the x axis

as you can see, the graph of our function is a line, and for that reason its called a linear function



slope

find the eqn

different forms of the eqn

implicit form

etc
