COURSE PREFACE

elementary algebra (a serious introduction to mathematics)

This video is an introduction to a video series about elementary algebra. So elementary algebra is a very useful extension to normal arithmetic. This topic usually deals with matters such as variables, equations, systems of equations, functions, and interpretation of functions and equations

since this is my video series I will be also including some of my favorite topics such as logic and proofs to a certain extent.

And of course please do the practice questions, they will help you understand the concepts explored in this video better.

Now be before we begin, I would like to note that this series does not require knowledge of anything other and basic arithmetic, but to make sure that we are on the same page lets just review a few facts.

-1 * -1 = 1, -1 + -1 = 0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DEFINITIONS AND IDEAS

Lets begin, first I want to introduce the idea of a variable

"x"

at this point x can be any number, we say

"x in R"

x is in the set of real numbers, the set real numbers contain every single number, with and without decimals

normally we denote variables with letters  from the start or end of the English alphabet

x, y, z, a, b, c

variables represent the idea of a number, not a specific number, a general one

Lets move on to what an equation is, an equations is two strings of characters and numbers with an equal sign in between them.

x - 5 = 2

It is important to remember that an equation is actually a judgement. So we can think of our equation x - 5 = 2 as a judgement (statement) that says

x - 5 = 2 is true
x minus 5 equals 2 is true, or x - 5 **is** equal to 2

lets define our equation like this just so that we get used to the idea

define: x - 5 = 2 is true

Now before we can start to work with equations we need one more thing, we need a rule that tells us how to manipulate these equations. This rule will be a theorem, which is result in mathematics that has been proven in mathematics

Theorem 1:
for all x in R, for all f in F, x = y is true => f[x] = f[y] is true

ok lets break it down.
for all x in R, any real number

for all f in F
any function in f, a function is a description of a modification to a variable, for example I have a function called add2 the function add2 adds 2 to whatever input you give it.

add2[1] = 1 + 2
add2[1] = 3

add2[1] can be read as, apply the function add2 to 1, if I apply add 2 to 1 I get 1 + 2

I can also apply the function to a variable, a general number
add2[a] = a + 2

if x = y is true
then f[x] = f[x] is true

using the example from before
2 = 2 is true
add2[2] = add2[2] is true
2 + 2 = 2 + 2 is true
4 = 4 is true

the idea of this theorem is quite simple, if I know that two quantities are equal (x = y) then if you change both quantities in the equation in the exact same way, they will still be equal after the change (f[x] = f[y])

now with these tools lets take a look at how we can solve some equations

ex1
- lets see this theorem in practice
- using this theorem we can solve for the specific value of x if we only have 1 variable in our equation

define: x - 5 = 1 is true

hypothesize: add5[a] = a + 5
infer: add5[x - 5] = add5[1] is true, by theorem 1
infer: x - 5 + 5 = 1 + 5 is true
infer: x = 6 is true

ex2
define: 3x = 3

hypothesize: divide3[a] = a/3
infer: divide3[3x] = divide3[3] is true, by theorem 1
infer: 3x/3 = 3/3 is ture
infer: x = 1 is true

ex3
define: x/5 = 2

often we don't name our functions with meaningful names but just give them a general name like f, g or h

hypothesize: f[a] = 5a
infer: f[x/5] = f[2] is true
infer: x/5 * 5 = 2 * 5 is true
infer: x = 10 is true

ex4

define: (2x+5)/4 = 3

hypothesize: f[a] = 4a
hypothesize: g[a] = a - 5
hypothesize: h[a] = a/2
infer: f[(2x+5)/4] = f[3] is true
infer: (2x+5)/4 * 4 = 3*4 is true
infer: 2x+5 = 12 is true
infer: g[2x+5] = g[12] is true
infer: 2x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5 is true
infer: 2x = 7 is true
infer: h[2x] = h[7]
infer: x = 7/2 = 3.5 is true

usually people solve equations without writing out in extreme detail every step as I did above, but I wanted to do that for a bit to emphasize that equations make a statement about the truth of something, I do see from time to time people that get confused about equations vs expressions, and even more people that get really confused about proofs so I want to make sure that we are on the same page about this

this is how people normally write out their work for solving equations, and you guys can feel free to do it like this

define: (x+5)/4 = 3+x/3 is true

(x+5)/4 = (3+2x)/4
((x+5)/4)*4 = ((3+2x)/4)*4
x+5-3 = 3+2x - 3
x + 2 - x = 2x - x
2 = x

x^2 = 4
sqrt[x^2] = 2
x = 2, right?

- its true that x = 2 since 2*2 = 4, but -2 * -2 = 4

so
+-x = 2
x = +-2

- now we have a new theorem
theorem 2: for all x, x^2 = k is true => x = +- sqrt[k]
